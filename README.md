# 📘 js-learning

Welcome to **js-learning**, a personal project and reference repository where I explore and document everything about **JavaScript** — from the basics to advanced concepts — using plain JavaScript.

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About

This is a learning-focused repository. It contains:

- JavaScript basics (variables, functions, loops, etc.)
- DOM manipulation
- Events and event listeners
- ES6+ features (let/const, arrow functions, etc.)
- Async JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- Mini projects and practice challenges

I’m using this repo to track my progress as I learn and build with JavaScript.
